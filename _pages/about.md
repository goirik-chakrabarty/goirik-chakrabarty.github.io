Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Goirik Chakrabarty, and I am interested in Lifelong Learning and Multimodal Learning. From my experience with computer vision and continual learning and my current research project in vision-language modelsðŸ¤–, I find it a critical field for real-world application. I aim to apply the principles of robustness and reliability that I have learnt in continual learning to the use of foundation models such as StableDiffusion and CLIP. 
<!-- I aim to develop general methods that provide value across many fields. -->

I am currently working as a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at TCS Research under [Ramya Hebbalaguppe](https://rhebbalaguppe.github.io/) in collaboration with [Prathosh A.P. (IISc Bangalore)](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh)  

Prior to this, I completed my MS Thesis titled,"[Continual Domain Incremental Learning during Test-time](http://dr.iiserpune.ac.in:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/7830/20181079_Goirik_MS_Thesis.pdf?sequence=1)" under the supervision of [Soma Biswas (IISc Bangalore)](https://sites.google.com/iisc.ac.in/somabiswas) and [Leelavati Narlikar (IISER Pune)](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/data-science/people/faculty/regular-faculty/leelavati-narlikar/355). 

<!-- I intend to specialize in Domain Generalization, Transfer Learning and Unsupervised Machine Learning. From my experience with computer vision and my current research project in domain adaptation and continual learning, I find it a critical field for real-world application. I aim to develop general methods that provide value across many fields. More explainable and general models will help us adapt them quickly to any problem statement. Consequently, weâ€™ll need only a few generalized models across multiple domains. -->

I am actively looking for PhD opportunities related to Robust, Reliable and Explainable Machine Learning! Feel free to [contact me](mailto:chakrabarty.goirik@gmail.com) ðŸ˜„
